# lakeCoSTR User Guide

We created lakeCoSTR to make the acquisition and analysis of Landsat's Collection 2 Surface Temperature product more accessible for those interested in obtaining historical estimates of lake temperature from remote sensing data. This tool is geared to researchers interested in gathering historical temperature estimates, especially for small lakes, who don't necessarily have experience working with remote sensing data. lakeCoSTR is an open-source tool, but please cite accordingly. 


## Constraints and Caveats 

lakeCoSTR works best for small lakes.

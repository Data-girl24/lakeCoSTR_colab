# lakeCoSTR for Colab

lakeCoSTR is a Python notebook for Google Colaboratory to facilitate the acquisition and aggregation of the Landsat Collection 2 surface temperature product for global lakes. lakeCoSTR also will pair user-provided *in situ* data with the Landsat record, providing a ground-truth dataset for users to aess the performance of the Landsat Collection 2 surface temperature estimates for their lake of interest. Please refer to the [User Guide](https://github.com/lakeCoSTR/lakeCoSTR_colab/blob/main/UserGuide_lakeCoSTR_colab.md) prior to using the tool.
